## My experience with Markdown

I use R Markdown for my Stat 404 assignments, but only into pdf for handing in. This is my first time using GitHub. 

### How I made this

* Cloned the file, edited on RStudio
* Committed, pushed from RStudio
* Tried to edit on both RStudio and the browser at the same time... lesson learned. 

$$ A_B^C + B/A $$
  
  *Unfortunately the equations aren't showing up - the discussion board has more info on that*
