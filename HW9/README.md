## Reflections
* it was very useful to use the Makefile and see how I could automate it so quickly. Some problems I had included not building and testing at the same time - instead, I wrote all the code and tested at once, and had a difficult time trying to figure out where the error originated from. 
* one thing I would do differently next time is to be more organized in my files - e.g. split the data, plots, and other files into separate folders, to avoid confusion as the html files are being created.
