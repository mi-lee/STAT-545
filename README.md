Michelle Lee's Repository
==========================
# Intro

* My name is Michelle and I'm a 4th year UBC student. 

* **Here's a link to the site:** [STAT545A](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/hw01_edit-README.html)

## My experience with Markdown

I use Markdown for my Stat404 assignments, so it's not too new - but this is my first time using Github.

### How I made this

* Cloned the file, edited on RStudio
* Committed, pushed from RStudio
* Tried to edit on both RStudio and the browser at the same time... lesson learned. 

$$ A_B^C + B/A $$

*Unfortunately the equations aren't showing up - the discussion board has more info on that*


Here's a picture
