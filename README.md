# Intro

1. **Intro**: My name is Michelle and I'm a 4th year UBC student. 

## Link to Site
[STAT545A ](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/hw01_edit-README.html)

### Reflections

I use Markdown for my Stat404 assignments, so it's not too new - but this is my first time using Github. 


**testing** 

$$ A_B^C + B/A $$

2. LaTeX equations are not showing up... the Stat545a question thread has more details on how to make it work.
